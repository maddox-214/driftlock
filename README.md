# Driftlock

AI agents are unpredictable, and a single runaway loop can burn hundreds of dollars before anyone notices — tools like LangSmith and Helicone only tell you after it already happened. Driftlock runs *inside* your agent's execution and intervenes **before** the breach: it projects spend from the live burn rate and downgrades models, pauses runs, or kills them outright when a mission budget is about to blow. It's a drop-in wrapper around the OpenAI and Anthropic clients with a policy engine, cost optimizer, and cache underneath.

```bash
pip install driftlock
```

No API key needed — this runs the full pipeline (mission, guardrails, interventions, SQLite) with simulated LLM calls:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/devdoxxx/driftlock && cd driftlock
pip install -e .
python examples/agent_demo.py "impact of interest rates on tech stocks"
```

```

The agent never actually exceeded its budget. Driftlock **projected** the breach from the live burn rate and downgraded the model *before* the expensive calls went out — the run finished at 53% of budget instead of 135%. Add `--kill` for a hard stop instead.

## How it works

### Basic call tracking

`DriftlockClient` is a drop-in for `openai.OpenAI()`. Every call is costed, timed, and saved to local SQLite — no other code changes.

```python
from driftlock import DriftlockClient

client = DriftlockClient(api_key="sk-...")
client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}],
)
```

### Policy engine

Rules run before every call and block, downgrade, or rate-limit a request the moment it violates a budget.

```python
from driftlock import DriftlockClient, PolicyEngine, MonthlyBudgetRule

policy = PolicyEngine(rules=[MonthlyBudgetRule(max_usd=100.0)])
client = DriftlockClient(api_key="sk-...", policy=policy)   # raises once $100/month is hit
```

### Mission budgets

A mission wraps a whole agent run and intervenes mid-execution when projected spend crosses the budget.

```python
import driftlock

with driftlock.mission("research", budget_usd=1.00,
                       on_exceed="downgrade", downgrade_to="gpt-4o-mini") as m:
    result = run_agent(topic, client)     # any number of tracked calls
    print(m.spent, m.status)
```

## Integrations

- **OpenAI** — drop-in `DriftlockClient` (sync, async, streaming). See [examples/basic_usage.py](examples/basic_usage.py).
- **Anthropic** — `AnthropicDriftlockClient` for the Messages API. See [examples/demo.py](examples/demo.py).
- **LangChain** — attach `DriftlockCallbackHandler` to any chat model. See [examples/langchain_agent_demo.py](examples/langchain_agent_demo.py).
- **LangGraph** — wrap a compiled graph in `DriftlockLangGraphMiddleware` for per-node attribution. See [examples/langgraph_agent_demo.py](examples/langgraph_agent_demo.py).

## How it compares

| Feature | Driftlock | LangSmith / Helicone |
|---|---|---|
| Observability (traces, cost logs) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Runtime intervention (before the next call) | ✅ | ❌ (post-hoc only) |
| Mission budgets for multi-call agent runs | ✅ | ❌ |
| Automatic model downgrade on budget pressure | ✅ | ❌ |
| Framework-agnostic (raw SDK, LangChain, LangGraph) | ✅ | Partial |
